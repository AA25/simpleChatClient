# simpleChatClient

Implement a simple chat client which transmits user messages to a multicast address and receives messages sent from other clients on other machines sent to the same 
multicast address. 

"When implementing the chat client, as a minimum, you will need to implement the transmitter code and the listener code as separate threads so that live messages 
from other sources may be received and displayed while the user is also typing a new message to be sent."
